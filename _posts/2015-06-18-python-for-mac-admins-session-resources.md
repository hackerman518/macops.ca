On June 18 and 19, I'll be giving a talk at the [MacDeploy](http://macdeployment.ca) and [MacDevOpsYVR](http://www.macdevops.ca) conferences, respectively in Calgary and Vancouver. The talk is a whirlwind introduction to "Python for Mac Admins" and is mostly based on code snippets and examples that I'll be talking through in an interactive Python environment.

If you'd like to follow along, I'm putting the [code resources up on GitHub](https://github.com/timsutton/python-macadmins-2015), which you can clone or download a zip archive of from the website. I'd recommend cloning it with Git (`git clone https://github.com/timsutton/python-macadmins-2015`) so that you can pull any changes I add after this post has been published.

Looking forward to seeing some of you there!

**Update:** MacDevOps published videos of the recorded sessions. You can find mine [here](http://macdevops.ca/MDO2015/tim/Default.html).
