title: Preview to Mac Software Deployment Session at MacADUK 2017
---

This year I'm very excited to be attending and speaking at the [Mac Admin & Developer Conference UK 2017](http://www.macad.uk/) in London, with a session called ["Advanced Mac Software Deployment and Configuration: Just Make It Work!"](http://www.macad.uk/speaker/tim-sutton-advanced-mac-software-deployment-configuration/)

[Amsys](http://www.amsys.co.uk/) have just published a preview post about this session which you can read about [here on their blog](http://www.amsys.co.uk/2017/01/advanced-mac-software-deployment-configuration/), to get more of an idea of what I plan to cover.

Though I wasn't able to attend this conference last year, I heard great things about it. [Get a ticket](http://www.macad.uk/buy-passes/) before it sells out!
