Pepijn Bruienne just posted a [nice summary](http://enterprisemac.bruienne.com/2015/05/05/conference-news/) of the Apple administration-focused conferences coming up in 2015. I'm also happy to be a small part of several of those coming up:

[Anthony Reimer](http://jazzace.ca) has organized for its second year the [MacDeployment workshop](http://arts.ucalgary.ca/macdeployment/), hosted at the University of Calgary's [Integrated Arts Media Labs](http://www.ucalgary.ca/iaml/). I'm looking forward to visiting as the IAML seems similar to the environment I support at Concordia University's Faculty of Fine Arts, and the [Prairies](http://calgary.ctvnews.ca/ndp-wins-alberta-provincial-election-ending-pc-reign-1.2360866) are one of the only parts of Canada I've not yet visited.

Thanks to some great timing, one day later I'll be speaking at the new [MacDevOps YVR](http://www.macdevops.ca) conference taking place at Simon Fraser University in Vancouver, organized by [Mat X](https://twitter.com/macvfx) and [Brian Warsing](https://twitter.com/dayglojesus). Mat and Brian have recruited a great lineup of speakers, so it's going to be a very packed day. I was born in BC but didn't grow up there, and it will be almost exactly 15 years since I was last in Vancouver.

These two days (June 18-19) I'll be giving an introduction to [Python](https://www.python.org) in the context of Mac administration.

Finally, I'm lucky to be returning to GÃ¶teborg, Sweden for [MacSysAdmin 2015](http://macsysadmin.se/2015) on September 29 through October 2. It was an absolute pleasure last year to attend, speak and meet so many members of our community, thanks to [Tycho](https://twitter.com/tychosjogren) - and I'm looking forward to traveling there again. [This time](http://macsysadmin.se/2015/Program.html) I'll be giving a tour and demoing some of my Mac sysadmin tools I maintain on [GitHub](https://github.com/timsutton).

Hope to see you at these great events!
