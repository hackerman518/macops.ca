title: MacTech Deployment Discussion/BOF/Q&A Notes
---

At MacTech Conference 2014 in Los Angeles, [Graham Gilbert](http://grahamgilbert.com/) and myself conducted a discussion / birds-of-a-feather session on the broad topic of OS and software deployment for OS X and iOS.

[Allister Banks](http://resume.aru-b.com) was present and dutifully took notes and reference URLs of specifics that were mentioned - solutions, blog posts, and other resources. We thought these would be great to share:
