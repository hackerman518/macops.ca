On October 5, I gave a presentation at my favourite conference - [MacSysAdmin](https://www.macsysadmin.se/) in GÃ¶teborg, Sweden - titled "Riding Your Next Mac Admin Wave."

It was the last day and the first talk of the morning after the beer bash event, so bonus points to all of you who made it! This page is a list of references from the talk's contents.

Links to the slides and video recording can be found on the [talks]({{< relref "/page/talks.md" >}}) page.
