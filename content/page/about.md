My name is Tim Sutton - Mac Operations is a technical blog dedicated to topics in systems administration, mostly in the context of macOS. Frequent topics include installers and packaging, automation tooling, software and OS deployment, Xcode and Apple's command line tools, Python, [Munki](https://github.com/munki/munki).

Some projects and tools I've worked on can be found on [GitHub](https://github.com/timsutton), and conference session videos/slides [here](/talks). I'm on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/tvsutton) and [e-mail](mailto:tim@synthist.net).

Thanks to the software that powers this blog: [Hugo](https://gohugo.io) and the [Kiko](https://github.com/gfjaru/Kiko) Jekyll theme, which has been modified and ported to Hugo. The source for this site can be found [here](https://github.com/timsutton/macops.ca).

This site ties into two external services: An [instance](https://stats.macops.ca/) of [Piwik](https://piwik.org/) is hosted on the same VPS as this blog, and used only by me for basic analytics on the site. [Disqus](https://disqus.com/) is used to provide comments for posts, and Disqus uses Google Analytics. I don't use Google Analytics on this site. The [Do Not Track](http://donottrack.us/) setting supported by web browsers is also enabled in Piwik should you wish to opt out of tracking.
