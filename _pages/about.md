My name is Tim Sutton - Mac Operations is a technical blog dedicated to topics in systems administration, mostly in the context of OS X. Frequent topics include installers and packaging, deploying software, Xcode and command line tools, Python, Munki, and various tricks and tools used to automate and glue components together.

Some projects and tools I've worked on can be found on [GitHub](https://github.com/timsutton), and conference session videos/slides [here](/talks). I'm on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/tvsutton) and [e-mail](mailto:tim@synthist.net).

Thanks to the software that powers this blog: [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com) and a modified version of the [Kiko](https://github.com/gfjaru/Kiko) theme.
